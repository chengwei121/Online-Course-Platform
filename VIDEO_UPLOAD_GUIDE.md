## Video Upload Issues & Solutions

### WMV Files - Common Issues

**Problem:** WMV files take too long to upload or fail to upload.

**Why?**
- WMV (Windows Media Video) files are typically **very large** (100MB - 500MB+)
- They use older compression technology compared to modern formats
- Upload time depends on file size and internet speed
- Not well supported by web browsers

**Solutions:**

### 1. Convert to MP4 (Recommended) ✅

**Benefits:**
- 50-70% smaller file size
- Faster uploads
- Better browser compatibility
- Better streaming performance

2. Select MP4 as output format
3. Choose H.264 codec for best compatibility
4. Download the converted file
5. Upload to the platform

### 2. Use Video URL Instead

If conversion is not possible:
1. Upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo
2. Get the video URL
3. Use the "Video URL" option when creating/editing lesson
4. Paste the URL instead of uploading

**Advantages:**

- Automatic quality adjustment for viewers

### 3. Upload During Off-Peak Hours

If you must upload WMV:
- Upload during late night or early morning
