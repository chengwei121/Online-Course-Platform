# Student Enrollment Notification System

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. Enrollment Notifications for Teachers

When a student enrolls in a course (either free or paid), the course teacher automatically receives:

#### Email Notification
- Subject: "New Student Enrolled: [Course Title]"
- Contains:
  - Student name and email
  - Course title
  - Enrollment date and time
  - Payment status
  - Amount paid
  - Direct link to view the course

#### Database Notification
- Stored in the `notifications` table
- Shows in teacher's notification panel (if implemented)
- Contains all enrollment details in JSON format

### 2. Notification Triggers

Notifications are sent automatically when:

1. **Free Course Enrollment** (`EnrollmentController`)
   - Student enrolls in a free course
   - Payment status: completed
   - Amount: RM 0.00

2. **Paid Course Enrollment** (`PayPalController`)
   - Student completes PayPal payment
   - Payment status: completed
   - Amount: Course price

### 3. Notification Data Structure

```php
[
    'type' => 'student_enrolled',
    'student_id' => 123,
    'student_name' => 'John Doe',
    'student_email' => 'john@example.com',
    'course_id' => 456,
    'course_title' => 'Course Name',
    'enrollment_id' => 789,
    'payment_status' => 'completed',
    'amount_paid' => 99.00,
    'enrolled_at' => '2025-10-10 12:30:45',
    'message' => 'John Doe has enrolled in your course: Course Name'
]
```

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `app/Notifications/StudentEnrolledNotification.php` - Notification class

### Modified:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Client/EnrollmentController.php` - Added notification for free courses
- `app/Http/Controllers/PayPalController.php` - Added notification for paid courses

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Student enrolls in a course (free or paid)
2. Enrollment record is created in database
3. System checks if course has a teacher
4. If teacher exists, notification is sent via:
   - Database (for in-app notifications)
   - Email (queued for async sending)
5. Teacher receives notification with all enrollment details

## 📧 Email Configuration

Make sure your `.env` file has proper mail configuration:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

## 🚀 Testing

To test the notification:

1. As a student, enroll in a free course
2. Or complete a PayPal payment for a paid course
3. Check teacher's email
4. Check database `notifications` table

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- Notifications are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- If notification fails, enrollment still succeeds
- Errors are logged but don't interrupt payment flow
- This prevents notification failures from breaking core functionality

## ❌ Chat Functionality Removed

### Removed Items:

1. **Route**: `Route::post('students/{student}/message')`
2. **View Elements**:
   - Message button from students list
   - Message modal dialog
   - JavaScript functions: `openMessageModal()`, `sendMessage()`
3. **CSS**:
   - `.btn-message` button styles

### What Remains:

- Students list still shows all enrolled students
- "View Details" button still works
- All other student management features intact

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

To display notifications in the teacher panel UI:

1. Create a notifications dropdown in teacher navigation
2. Query unread notifications: `auth()->user()->unreadNotifications`
3. Mark as read: `$notification->markAsRead()`
4. Show notification count badge
5. Add notifications page to view all notifications

Example query:
```php
$notifications = auth()->user()
    ->notifications()
    ->where('type', 'App\\Notifications\\StudentEnrolledNotification')
    ->latest()
    ->take(10)
    ->get();
```
